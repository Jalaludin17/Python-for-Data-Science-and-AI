# Python-for-Gen-AI

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks from my online Python classes designed for students and professionals interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Each notebook follows a structured curriculum and provides practical, hands-on experience with Python programming.

We cover:
- Python fundamentals  
- Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Introductory Machine Learning concepts  
- Real-world projects and exercises  

Notebooks are organized by class session and updated regularly to support progressive learning.

## üìå About Python

Python is a powerful, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, AI, web development, automation, and more.

**Why Python?**
- Simple and readable syntax (great for beginners)
- Large standard library and vibrant community
- Powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- Cross-platform and open source

Python is interpreted, meaning you can write and run your code without compiling it. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
